              <h3>I'm a Computer Science Graduate</h3>
              <p>
                Hi, I'm Harsha Chaithanya, a computer science graduate with a passion for software development. I have a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures gained through my academic studies. I am enthusiastic about creating innovative and efficient software solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my time in university, I worked on various projects that allowed me to develop my skills in programming languages like Java, C++, and Python. I'm also comfortable working with databases such as MySQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have done the Machine Learning specialization, which focuses on implementing linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machines. Additionally, explore unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a strong desire to continue learning and exploring new technologies in the software development field. I enjoy solving complex problems and collaborating with teams to create robust and scalable software solutions. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact through software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have any exciting software development opportunities or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to contribute to meaningful projects and expand my horizons in the world of software development.
